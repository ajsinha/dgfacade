 * Core handler interface for DGFacade.

 *

 *   1. construct() - Initialize with configuration from handler JSON
 *   2. execute()   - Process the request and return a response
 *   3. stop()      - Called when TTL expires or execution completes. Signal to stop work.
 *   4. cleanup()   - Final cleanup of resources
 *
 * Handlers are instantiated per-request and managed by Pekko actors.
 * Millions of handlers may run concurrently.
